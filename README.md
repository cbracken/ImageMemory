# Flutter vs Objective-C iOS app memory comparison

A rough side-by-side comparison of iOS vs stock UIKit network image loading and
caching.

## Allocation profiles

Archived allocation profiles for download:
* [Flutter implementation](https://github.com/cbracken/ImageMemory/raw/master/DeviceFlutterAllocations.trace.zip)
* [Objective-C implementation](https://github.com/cbracken/ImageMemory/raw/master/DeviceObjcAllocations.trace.zip)

## Repro instructions

The following instructions can be used to reproduce the checked-in allocation
profiles.

All steps were carried out using:
* Xcode 9.2 (9C40b)
* Flutter at `0c09179b65d6e6f5cbf4da178d7d6e23fae5f7a9` on the `master` branch
* A physical iPhone X.

Notes:
* Perform native profiling using a release build: Flutter generates very
  different code and allocation profiles when running in debug mode vs release
  mode.
* Use a physical device: on simulator builds, Flutter uses a software graphics
  stack rather than hardware-based, resulting in significantly different
  allocation profiles.

### Profile the Flutter implementation

1. Open `image_memory_flutter/ios/Runner.xcworkspace` and set the development team
for code signing.

2. Run the app in release mode on the phone.
```shell
$ cd image_memory_flutter
$ flutter run -d deviceName --release
```

3. Open Instruments from Xcode: From the *Xcode* menu, select *Open Developer Tool* > *Instruments*.

4. At the top of the main Instruments window, select the device, then select the *image_memory*.

5. Double-click *Allocations*.

6. In the allocations window that opens, click the record button. The app will start on the device.

7. Scroll down to the bottom of the list of images, then back to the top. Repeat once more.

8. Click the stop button in the allocations window.

9. Save the allocation profile.

### Profile the Objective-C implementation

1. Open `ImageMemoryObjc.xcodeproj`

2. At the top of the Xcode window, long-click the *Play* button and select *Profile*.

3. Click the *Profile* button.

4. The Instruments window will open. Double-click *Allocations*.

5. In the allocations window that opens, click the record button. The app will start on the device.

6. Scroll down to the bottom of the list of images, then back to the top. Repeat once more.

7. Click the stop button in the allocations window.

8. Save the allocation profile.
